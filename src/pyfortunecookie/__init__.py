This file is required for Python to recognize the directory as a "regular" package.

Python "regular" packages use the __init__.py file to initialize the package and
can include package-level variables, import statements, and initialization code
you wish to run when the package is first imported into a program.

For more information, see the official documentation:
https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages
